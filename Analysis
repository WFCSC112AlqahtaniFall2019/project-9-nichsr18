Bubble Sort is the most inefficient when the vector is unsorted. This is because in the worst case Bubble Sort has an O(n^2) complexity. Interestingly, in my project there was a significant difference between Bubble Sort with the Data vector and integer array. With an unsorted vector Selection Sort is more efficient than Bubble Sort but is not as efficient as Quick or Merge Sort. In the worst case, Selection Sort has a complexity of O(n^2). While BubbleSort runs the worst case unless the vector is sorted the worst case with selection sort would be if every element needs to be moved which rarely happens. For Bubble Sort if the vector is sorted it has a complexity of O(n) which is more efficient than Selection Sort on a sorted list which still has a complexity of O(n^2) on a sorted list.
